# detect-environment

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40betsol%2Fdetect-environment.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40betsol%2Fdetect-environment)

Detects environment by examining CLI arguments and NODE_ENV.

## Features

- Two detection methods: `CLI` and `NODE_ENV`
- Detection methods, the order of their use and the list of environments are fully configurable
- Enables shorthand syntax and environment name aliases
- Very small module with single dependency
- Written in TypeScript, shipped with typings
- Targeted to ES6


## Installation

### yarn

`yarn add @betsol/detect-environment`

### npm

`npm i @betsol/detect-environment`


## Usage

Require the module and call it to detect the environment. Pass options to alter the default behavior.
Library will always return the canonical name of the detected environment even if shorthand syntax was used.

The module will sequentially iterate over various detection methods until environment will be detected,
otherwise it will fallback to default environment.

> The order and availability of detection methods could be configured through `methods` option.

### Detection Methods

#### `CLI`

This method detects environment by examining the CLI arguments passed to your program.

Various call formats are possible:

- `$ app --environment=production` — This is the longest "canonical" form
- `$ app --env=production` — Shorthand `"env"` argument name could be used
- `$ app --environment=prod` — Shorthand `"prod"` environment name is used
- `$ app --env=prod` — Both of the above
- `$ app --production` — Just the canonical name of the environment is used
- `$ app --prod` — This is the shortest form, nice for development

> Canonical environment names and their aliases could be configured using `environments` option.

#### `NODE_ENV`

This method examines the value of `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

- `$ NODE_ENV=production app` — Longest "canonical" form
- `$ NODE_ENV=prod app` — Shorthand environment name could be used


### Minimal Example

```js
const detectEnvironment = require('@betsol/detect-environment');

const ENVIRONMENT = detectEnvironment();

// ENVIRONMENT = "development"
```

### Default Options Example

```js
const detectEnvironment = require('@betsol/detect-environment');

const ENVIRONMENT = detectEnvironment({
  environments: {
    production: {
      aliases: ['prod']
    },
    development: {
      aliases: ['dev']
    }
  },
  methods: ['CLI', 'NODE_ENV'],
  defaultEnvironment: 'development'
});

// ENVIRONMENT = "development"
```

## Options

- `environments` — is map where each key is a canonical environment name, e.g. `prodution`.
- `environments[].aliases` — is a string array of all shorthand/alternative environment names,
  e.g.: `['dev', 'develop', 'local']`
- `methods` — is a prioritized list of methods to use for environment detection.
  Possible values are: `CLI` and `NODE_ENV`.
- `defaultEnvironment` — fallback canonical environment name to be used by default, e.g.: `development`.
